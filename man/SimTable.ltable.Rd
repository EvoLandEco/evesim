\title{Convert SimTable object to Legacy L-table Format}
\usage{
SimTable.ltable(Robj)
}
\arguments{
\item{Robj}{A tagged external pointer to a \code{sim_table_t} object, which contains the SimTable simulation results.}
}
\value{
A \code{NumericMatrix} with four columns:
\describe{
\item{Column 1}{The birth time (t) of the lineage.}
\item{Column 2}{The ancestor of the lineage.}
\item{Column 3}{The label assigned to the lineage.}
\item{Column 4}{The death time of the lineage, or -1 if the lineage is still extant.}
}
}
\description{
This function extracts the simulation results from a SimTable object and converts them into
a legacy L-table format, represented as an R numeric matrix.
}
\details{
The L-table is a common representation of evolutionary simulations, where each row corresponds to a lineage
with its birth, ancestor, label, and death times. This function also preserves a known flaw in the legacy L-table
format where the second column's first element is manually set to -1.
}
\note{
For backward compatibility, the second element of the first row in the matrix (Column 2, Row 1) is set to -1 to reintroduce a known flaw in the legacy L-table format used in the DDD package.

\examples{
# Example usage
pars = c(0.5, 0.1, -0.001, -0.001, 0.0, 0.0)
sim_table <- evesim::edd_sim(pars = pars, age = 20, metric = "nnd", offset = "none")
ltable <- SimTable.ltable(sim_table$sim)
